# Bring Me The Horizon – Throne

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
REMEMBER THE MOMENT YOU LEFT ME ALONE
AND BROKE EVERY PROMISE
YOU EVER MADE I WAS AN OCEAN,
LOST IN THE OPEN, NOTHING COULD
TAKE THE PAIN AWAY.
SO YOU CAN THROW ME TO THE WOLVES,
TOMORROW I WILL COME BACK
LEADER OF THE WHOLE PACK BEAT ME BLACK
AND BLUE, EVERY WOUND
WILL SHAPE ME,
EVERY SCAR WILL BUILD MY THRONE.
THE STICKS AND THE STONES
THAT YOU USED TO THROW HAVE BUILT ME AN
EMPIRE SO DON'T EVEN TRY TO CRY ME A RIVER
COS' I FORGIVE YOU, YOU
ARE THE REASON I STILL FIGHT.
I'LL LEAVE YOU CHOKING
ON EVERY WORD YOU LEFT UNSPOKEN, REBUILD
ALL THAT YOU'VE BROKEN
AND NOW YOU KNOW EVERY WOUND WILL SHAPE
ME, EVERY SCAR WILL BUILD MY THRONE.
