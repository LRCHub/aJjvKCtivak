Their kingdom has fallen
And black mists dissolve
From us they have stolen
The sacred, divine call

Fall
Rise
And come forth

In infinity is the absence of time
Nothing can grow, nothing emerges
Everything a reflection of the same
So Death created a child called Time
To grow what it would kill
And we echo our lives and our cries
Born into the same crimson cage
We've always been born into

So we die for each other
With every single glance
The knowing and the sorrow
The dove's frail wings
Soaked in oblivious trance
Forever, watch it flee

Claw marks on the throne
The soulless architect
These dragons and conquerors
Crazed, blissful and frozen in fire
Claw marks on the throne
The silent chaos
Malevolent emperors
Crazed, blissful and frozen in fire

This newborn horizon
Already looks dead to me
These archons are waiting
To set the darkness free

Claw marks on the throne
The soulless architect
These dragons and conquerors
Crazed, blissful and frozen in fire
Claw marks on the throne
The silent chaos
Malevolent emperors
Rise!
