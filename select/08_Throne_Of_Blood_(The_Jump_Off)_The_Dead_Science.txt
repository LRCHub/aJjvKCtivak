Bloody thoughts you can't abandon
Sailing clouds in white gold zeppelin
Samurai, Young Gun, X-Man
Made each of these my royal fam
Villainaire, Ice Grillionaire
Tonight there's something in the air

Cast my heart out like an anchor
Sailing on a sea of rancor
Samurai, Young Gun, X-Man
Made each of these my royal fam
Villainaire, Ice Grillionaire
Tonight I feel there's something in the air

C alear black night, a clear white moon, the clipse of doom inside
To restore his flesh The Ol' Grey Ghost must find h is bride

Samurai, Young Gun, X-Man
Made each of these my royal fam

Villainaire, Ice Grillionaire
Tonight I fear there's something in the air

Hart of gold to gore the future
Bound to glory by blood-rich sutures
Samurai, Young Gun, X-Man
Made each of these my royal fam
Villainaire, Ice Grillionaire
Tonight I fear there's something in the air
