GIRL ON MY THRONE
winter blooms
covers my garden
what’s to lose
nothing moves
all of my feelings
frozen with you
but where we going doesn’t really matter
Ouuh , Oh yeah that’s her the girl who sits on my throne
Ouuh , I know her well we’re together when I’m alone
Ouuh , She tells me secrets that she tells to everyone
Ouuh , Will I fell anything unless I take her out my phone
my winter blues got me wrapped up in loops
yeah i’m all wrapped up , in you
HD, real life ?
digital words all night
party when we’re staying inside
Ooo I need it to be fake
paint me with a tint and daze
Ouuh , Oh yeah that’s her the girl who sits on my throne
Ouuh , I know her well we’re together when I’m alone
Ouuh , She tells me secrets that she tells to everyone
Ouuh , Will I fell anything unless I take her out my phone
Will I feel anything
Will I feel anything unless I take her out my phone
( will I feel it)
yeah I think about it when I wake up in the morning
( will I feel it )
as the sunset like a blanket I always knew
( will I feel it )
yeah, she tells me secrets that she tells to everyone, everyone
( will I feel it )
calling out to you
Ouuh , Oh yeah that’s her the girl who sits on my throne
Ouuh , I know her well we’re together when I’m alone
Ouuh , She tells me secrets that she tells to everyone
Ouuh , Will I fell anything unless I take her out my phone
